# taskmate-todolist
TaskMate is a simple and user-friendly to-do list application built with React. It allows users to easily manage their tasks by adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed. The app also provides a filtering feature to view tasks by their current statusâ€”whether they are active, completed, or all tasks combined.
